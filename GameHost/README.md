# Actinidia Host for Windows 10

This is a Windows 10 UWP program (C++/WinRT), which means you can download it from [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt).

If you don't have computers running Windows 10, you can try [*ActinidiaOnAndroid*](https://github.com/mooction/ActinidiaOnAndroid).

## Details

I use DirectX 11 to implement interfaces provided to lua.

Visual Studio 2017 & Windows SDK 10.0.17763.0 or higher version are required.
